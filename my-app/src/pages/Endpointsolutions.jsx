    <h1> End Point Security Solutions </h1>
    <br />
    <h4> Endpoint security is a key component of cybersecurity solutions that focuses on protecting endpoints such as computers, laptops and mobile devices from a variety of threats, such as malware, ransomware and phishing attacks, as well as unauthorized access. 
Endpoint security solutions use antivirus software, firewall, encryption and intrusion detection to protect endpoints from cyber threats. Advanced endpoint protection uses behavioral analytics and machine learning to identify and mitigate emerging threats in real time. 
Securing endpoints helps organizations mitigate risks, protect sensitive data and protect their network infrastructure from changing cyber threats.
      <br /> <br />
      (a)	Anti Virus Software:
Endpoint security includes a variety of tools, including antivirus software. Anti-virus software is used to detect, stop, and remove viruses, trojans, and other malicious software from individual computers, laptops, or mobile devices.
Antivirus software examines files and programs for malware signatures, suspicious behavior, and patterns that indicate an infection. It provides real-time monitoring of device activity and blocks threats as they occur. With regular updates and refreshes of the virus definition database, antivirus software remains strong against new and changing threats. 
By implementing antivirus software as a part of endpoint security, organizations can significantly mitigate the risk of malware infection and protect sensitive information from compromise.
<br /> <br />
(b)	Host Based Intrusion Prevention Systems(HIPS):
HIPS (Host-Based Interception Prevention System) is an essential part of endpoint security. HIPS monitors and analyzes activity on individual endpoints, such as computers and servers, in real-time to identify and prevent malicious activity. HIPS analyzes system events, network communications, and application behavior to detect and block suspicious activity. HIPS can block unauthorized access attempts and malware infections, as well as exploit software vulnerabilities. By proactively monitoring and responding to attacks, HIPS improves the security posture of endpoints and helps organizations reduce the risk of data breach and cyberattack.
<br /> <br />
(c)	Endpoint Detection Response (EDR):
Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is a key component of endpoint security. It swiftly identifies and responds to advanced threats on individual devices within a network. Offering real-time monitoring and rapid response capabilities, EDR systems enhance threat detection and mitigation, bolstering overall security posture.
Some key features of EDR are:- <br />
(1)	Continuous monitoring <br />
(2)	Threat detection <br />
(3)	Investigation and response <br /> 
(4)	Threat hunting <br /> 
(5)	Integration with security operations
