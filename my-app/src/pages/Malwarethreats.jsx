      <h1> Malware Threats </h1>
      <br />
      <h4> Malware threats encompass various malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems and data. Types include viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, and spyware. Malware can spread through email attachments, malicious websites, or infected files. It aims to compromise system integrity, steal sensitive information, or extort victims for financial gain, posing significant risks to cybersecurity.
        <br /> <br />
(a)	Viruses:
Viruses breach cybersecurity by exploiting vulnerabilities in computer systems or networks. They often infiltrate systems through infected email attachments, malicious downloads, or compromised websites. Once executed, viruses replicate themselves and spread throughout the system, causing damage by corrupting files, stealing data, or facilitating unauthorized access. By exploiting security weaknesses and spreading rapidly, viruses compromise system integrity, disrupt operations, and compromise sensitive information, posing significant threats to cybersecurity.
<br /> <br />
(b)	Worm:
Worms infiltrate cybersecurity by leveraging network vulnerabilities to proliferate swiftly across interconnected systems autonomously. They propagate by exploiting flaws in operating systems or software, facilitating their replication and dissemination throughout networks. Worms can disseminate via email, file-sharing platforms, or network connections, infecting computers and undermining system integrity, resulting in extensive disruption, data exfiltration, or unauthorized entry. Their capacity for self-replication and autonomous dissemination renders them notably perilous to cybersecurity.
<br /> <br />

(c)	Trojans:

Trojans compromise cybersecurity by masquerading as legitimate software or files to deceive users into downloading or executing them. Once activated, Trojans perform malicious actions, such as stealing sensitive information, creating backdoors for remote access, or installing additional malware. They often exploit social engineering tactics to trick users into installing them, bypassing security defenses. Trojans compromise system integrity, privacy, and confidentiality, posing significant risks to cybersecurity.
